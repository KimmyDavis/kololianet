      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p className="question">What is the cost of a website?</p>
      <p className="ans">
        The price of a website greatly depends on the nature of the website
        itself. After discussing the details of the site, we can immediately
        tell you the price.
      </p>

      <p className="question">What do I need to have a website?</p>
      <p className="ans">
        There's no prerequisites for having a website up and running. All we
        need from you is the details of how you would like us to design it. You
        may have an example website that you may like yours to look like or have
        a completely unique idea.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        How long does it take for a website to be accessible online?
      </p>
      <p className="ans">
        The maturity period of a website depends on the nature and amount of
        content that is required. However, we ensure that it's up and running in
        the shortest possible time.
      </p>

      <p className="ans">
